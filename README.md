# Deep-Learning---Utilizing-R
This repository contains deep learning activities I worked on using R.  Several deep learning techniques such as Forecasting and Prediction, Arima Modeling , Linear Regression, Neural Networks and as on were explored in the activities contained in this repository. Libraries such as Tensor flow, Keras etc. were used for some of the deep learning techniques.
