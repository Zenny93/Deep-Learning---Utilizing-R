#Problem 2a
#Use the full data set to perform a logistic regression with Direction as the response and the five lag variables plus Volume as predictors

logmodel <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data= Smarket, family="binomial")
summary(logmodel)


#Problem 2b
#Compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions. Use probability of 0.5 as the threshold.
confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(logmodel$fitted > 0.5, "Up", "Down")), as.factor(Smarket$Direction), positive = "Up")

#Problem 2c
#Using 2005 data as validation data and the rest as training data
#Plot ROC of the prediction in (b) and obtain corresponding AUC
roc_obj<-roc(as.factor(Smarket$Direction),logmodel$fitted)
plot.roc(roc_obj,legacy.axes=TRUE)
#auc == area under the curve
auc(roc_obj)

#Problem 2d
#Use the training data to build a logistic regression model as that in (a)
train.df = Smarket[Smarket$Year < 2005,]
valid.df = Smarket[Smarket$Year > 2004,]
logmodel2 <- glm(Direction ~ Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data= train.df, family="binomial")
summary(logmodel2)

#Problem 2e
#Use the model in (d), compute the confusion matrix and overall fraction of correct predictions for the validation period. Use probability of 0.5 as the threshold
#There is need to do a new predic to accomodate the valid period before computing the confusion matrix
smark.pred = predict(logmodel2, type="response", newdata = valid.df)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(ifelse(smark.pred> 0.5, "Up", "Down")), as.factor(valid.df$Direction), positive = "Up")

#Problem 2f
#Plot ROC of the prediction in (e) and obtain corresponding AUC for the validation period
roc_obj1<-roc(as.factor(valid.df$Direction), smark.pred)
plot.roc(roc_obj1,legacy.axes=TRUE)

##Problem 2a - Written
From the summary of the model it appears that none of them are statistically significant based on the p values.The p-values are relatively large.

#Problem 3
# Consider the AustralianWines.csv data. It includes  monthly sales of six types of Australian wines (red, rose, sweet white, dry white, sparkling, and fortified) for 1980-1994. Partition the fortified data using the period until December 1993 as the training period and the rest as the validation period

#Problem 3a
#Run a neural network using Râ€™s nnetar with 11 nonseasonal lags (i.e., p = 11) on training data. Leave all other arguments at their default. Show the model summary.

Wines.data <- read.csv("AustralianWines.csv")
Wines.ts <- ts(Wines.data$Fortified, start = c(1980,1), end = c(1994, 12),freq=12)
fixed.nValid <- 12
# since we have a fixed valid the rest will be training. 
fixed.nTrain <- length(Wines.ts) - fixed.nValid
#training period
Winestrain.ts <- window(Wines.ts, start=c(1980,1), end = c(1980, fixed.nTrain))
#validation period
Winesvalid.ts <- window(Wines.ts, start = c(1980, fixed.nTrain + 1), end = c(1980, fixed.nTrain + fixed.nValid))

nnmodel <- nnetar(Winestrain.ts,p=11,P=1)
nnmodel
summary(nnmodel)

#Problem 3b
#Create a time plot for the actual and forecasted series for the training period
plot(Winestrain.ts)
lines(nnmodel$fitted, col="red")

#Problem 3c
#Create also a time plot of the forecast errors for the training period
plot(Winestrain.ts-nnmodel$fitted)

#Problem 3d
#Use the neural network to forecast sales for each month in the validation period. Plot the observed and predicted values for validation period.
WinesPred <- forecast(nnmodel, h=fixed.nValid)
WinesPred$mean

plot(Winesvalid.ts)
lines(WinesPred$mean, col="red")

#Problem 3e
#Obtain forecast accuracy for the validation period.
accuracy(WinesPred, Winesvalid.ts)
